# Part 1


## To run this application:

Please be sure to read through the Angular CLI prerequesites found at the below resource. One installed, navigate to  the /InstacartShopperChallenge directory and run `ng-serve`

Highlights from Angular CLI README: 
"This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.0.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files."

## Design trade-offs and decisions:

The official Instacart shopper application collects much more data than what I have built for this challenge. I chose to focus more time on the overall polish of the application than extensive coverage of possible data input. That being said, I have built this application in such a way that it is can be expanded to increase data input. 

Please not that I did not write unit tests or end to end tests for this project. This is something I would focus on with more time. Rather than writing these tests after building the application, I would have developed them at the same time as writing my components and services. Again, this was a decision made based based on the time constraints of the challenge. 


### PART 2: 

You will need to add the sqlite file in the same directory as challenge.py for it to function. It was too large to add to github.
